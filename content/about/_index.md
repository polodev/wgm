# this site made only for self study purpose
# Why I have created this page
any topic will be added here entirely in single markdown post. so it will help me to visualize entire tech stack
# dtags only for decks

# what need to be done
use all js library in relative url instead of cdn. since if I missed electricity still I will be able to work. get a solution for packing all js in single minified file
